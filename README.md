# **AgroEdge Pitch Deck:Transforming Agritech Educations**

---

**AgroEdge is revolutionizing agritech education by empowering young individuals with hands-on skills in Dairy Farming and Biofloc Fish Farming. We provide industry-relevant training, financial support through NBFCs, and post-course capital, ensuring every graduate is set up for success.**

---

## **2. Problem Statement**

- **Unemployment & Underutilized Workforce**: India has a vast rural youth population struggling with employment due to lack of skill-based training in agriculture.
- **Traditional Farming Challenges**: Limited access to modern farming techniques and financial constraints prevent small-scale farmers from scaling.
- **Gap in Agritech Education**: There is no structured commercial farming training program linked with financial aid and post-training capital.

---

## **3. Solution: The AgroEdge Model**

1. **Skill Development**: Comprehensive training in Dairy Farming & Biofloc Fish Farming.
2. **Financial Support**: Each student receives a **₹8 lakh education loan from NBFCs**, with:
    - **₹2 lakh** as course fees (paid to AgroEdge).
    - **₹6 lakh** disbursed to the student as a business setup fund.
3. **Hands-On Experience**: Students train on real farms, ensuring practical knowledge.
4. **Mentorship & Growth**: Ongoing business support post-training to ensure success.

---

## **4. Market Opportunity**
